# Project Structure

This project has been restructured to separate the frontend and backend concerns.

## `frontend/`

This directory contains the entire Next.js frontend application. All the source code, public assets, and configuration files are located here.

## `backend/`

This directory is intended for the backend application. Currently, it is empty as no backend code was found in the original project.
